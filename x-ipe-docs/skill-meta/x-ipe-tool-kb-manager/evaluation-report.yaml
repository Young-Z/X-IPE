  decision: MERGE
  rationale: |
    must_pass_rate=100% (10/10) meets required 100%.
    should_pass_rate=100% (2/2) exceeds required 80%.
    could test failure (templates dir) is acceptable — tool skill has no template outputs.
    Skill already merged to .github/skills/x-ipe-tool-kb-manager/ in prior step.
    No iteration needed.
