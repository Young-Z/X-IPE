Code blocks in SKILL.md with line counts:
- Block at lines 53-59: 6 lines (Input Parameters YAML)
- Block at lines 65-84: 19 lines (DoR XML)
- Block at lines 106-256: 150 lines (Execution Procedure XML)
- Block at lines 262-275: 13 lines (Output Result YAML)
- Block at lines 283-314: 31 lines (DoD XML)

Structural observations:
- Main procedure block is 150 lines (exceeds 20-line threshold)
- Complex details ARE referenced to references/ folder
- Examples delegated to references/examples.md
- Sub-agent workflow delegated to references/sub-agent-workflow.md

Note: This requires judge_agent evaluation to assess if procedure block should be shortened.
