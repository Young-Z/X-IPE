# Idea Summary

> Idea ID: IDEA-019
> Folder: 019. CR-UIUX Reference
> Version: v2
> Created: 2026-02-14
> Status: Refined

## Overview

Redesign the UIUX Reference toolbar into a two-mode guided wizard system. The current toolbar's standalone color picker and element highlighter are replaced by two purpose-driven workflows: **Catch Design Theme** (extract a reusable design theme from any page) and **Copy Design as Mockup** (capture and replicate page components as pixel-perfect mockups). Both modes share a single toolbar panel with the hamburger menu as the sole entry point.

## Problem Statement

The current UIUX reference toolbar captures raw colors and elements but leaves users to manually assemble them into themes or mockups. There is no guided workflow to turn captured references into actionable design artifacts. Users need:
- A structured flow to extract design tokens and generate a brand theme automatically
- A way to capture components with enough fidelity for an AI agent to replicate them as 1:1 mockups
- Pixel-level color picking with magnification for precision across all visual sources (images, video, canvas, gradients)

## Target Users

- Designers and developers using X-IPE to capture design references from existing websites
- Agents that consume captured data to auto-generate themes and mockups via downstream skills

## Proposed Solution

Replace the existing toolbar with a hamburger-menu-driven panel offering two guided wizards. Each wizard uses a step-by-step UI. Behind the scenes, the UIUX reference skill chains to `x-ipe-tool-brand-theme-creator` (for themes) or a mockup creation skill (for mockups) via the agent interaction MCP.

    participant Toolbar
    participant Agent
    participant ThemeCreator as brand-theme-creator

    User->>Toolbar: Select "Catch Design Theme"
    Toolbar->>Toolbar: Expand step wizard

    Note over User,Toolbar: Step 1 — Pick Colors
    User->>Toolbar: Click pixels on page
    Toolbar->>Toolbar: Offscreen canvas sampling<br/>Circular magnifier (120px, 10x zoom)
    Toolbar->>Toolbar: Store {hex, rgb, hsl, source}

    Note over User,Toolbar: Step 2 — Annotate Roles
    User->>Toolbar: Assign role per color<br/>(primary|secondary|accent|custom)

    Note over User,Toolbar: Step 3 — Create Theme
    User->>Toolbar: Click "Create Theme"
    Toolbar->>Agent: Send annotated colors via __xipeRefReady
    Agent->>ThemeCreator: Invoke brand-theme-creator skill
    ThemeCreator-->>Agent: design-system.md + component-visualization.html
    Agent-->>Toolbar: Toast: "Theme created ✓"
```

- **Offscreen canvas color picker**: Renders the visible viewport to a hidden canvas for universal pixel-level sampling. Handles CSS gradients, images, video, canvas elements, and text. Same-origin content only (CORS limitation acknowledged).
- **Circular magnifier**: 120px diameter, 10x zoom, crosshair overlay for precise pixel targeting. Follows cursor in real-time. Rendered from the offscreen canvas data, throttled via `requestAnimationFrame`.
- **Role annotation**: Predefined chips (primary, secondary, accent) plus a free-text input for custom labels. Each collected color gets exactly one role.
- **Progress toasts**: Inline toast notifications at the bottom of the toolbar panel showing progress and completion status.

### Feature 2 — Copy Design as Mockup

    end
    Agent-->>Toolbar: Toast: "Mockup generated ✓"
```

- **Smart-snap selection**: Click detects nearest semantic container (`section`, `nav`, `article`, `card`, etc.) by traversing up from clicked element. **Fallback**: If no semantic element is found within 5 ancestor levels, snaps to the nearest `div` with both width > 50px and height > 50px. Draggable resize handles allow adjusting the selection boundary after snapping.
- **Lightweight initial capture**: First pass captures bounding box dimensions, a screenshot crop, and minimal computed styles (box model, colors, fonts, borders). Keeps payload small.
- **Agent analysis rubric**: The agent evaluates captured data across 5 dimensions:
  1. **Layout structure**: Is the spatial arrangement (flex/grid/position) captured?
  2. **Typography**: Are font family, size, weight, line-height, and color available?
  3. **Color palette**: Are background, border, and text colors captured?
  4. **Spacing & sizing**: Are margins, padding, and explicit dimensions present?
  5. **Visual effects**: Are shadows, border-radius, gradients, and opacity captured?
  
  Each dimension scored as confident/uncertain/missing. If any dimension is "missing", agent requests deeper capture from the toolbar for that specific area.
- **Metadata persistence before generation**: Step 4a saves all collected data (screenshots, HTML/CSS, dimensions, instructions) via the agent-interaction MCP **before** mockup generation begins. This ensures resumability if generation fails.
- **Iterative mockup validation**: After generating a mockup, agent compares its screenshot to the original. Comparison method and exact threshold (targeting ~90%) to be defined in technical design (options: pixel-diff, SSIM, or perceptual hash). If below threshold, loops back to analysis (max 3 auto-iterations). After 3 failed iterations, asks human for approval to continue or stop.
- **Per-component instructions**: Free-text box for each selected component to add context (e.g., "this is a sticky header", "animation on scroll").

### Shared Behaviors

- **Single toolbar panel**: Both modes share the same panel space. Only one mode is active at a time. Switching modes via hamburger menu.
- **Hamburger menu as sole entry point**: No standalone tools — all functionality accessed via the menu. Current standalone color picker and element highlighter are removed.
- **Inline toast notifications**: Progress messages appear at the bottom of the toolbar panel. States: info, in-progress (spinner), success (✓), error (✗).
- **Shared data session**: Both modes share the same `window.__xipeRefData` store. Colors captured in Theme mode are available if user switches to Mockup mode.

## Data Schema

Both modes produce structured data stored in `window.__xipeRefData`. The schema extends the existing format:

```json
{
  "mode": "theme | mockup",
  "colors": [
    {
      "id": "color-001",
      "hex": "#3730a3",
      "rgb": "55, 48, 163",
      "hsl": "246, 42%, 43%",
      "source_selector": "body > nav.header > .logo",
      "role": "primary | secondary | accent | {custom_text}",
      "context": ""
    }
  ],
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "comp-001",
      "selector": "body > main > section.hero",
      "tag": "section",
      "bounding_box": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 1440, "height": 600 },
      "screenshot_dataurl": "data:image/png;base64,...",
      "html_css": {
        "level": "minimal | deep",
        "computed_styles": {},
        "outer_html": "<section>...</section>"
      },
      "instruction": "This is the hero section with parallax scroll",
      "agent_analysis": {
        "confidence": {},
        "additional_captures": []
      }
    }
  ],
  "design_tokens": null
}
```

> **Note:** Detailed schema and downstream skill contracts (input/output interfaces for brand-theme-creator and mockup-creator) will be finalized during technical design.

## Bi-Directional Communication

The existing `__xipeRefReady` polling mechanism (agent polls every 3s) is sufficient for the "send" flow (toolbar → agent). For the mockup analysis loop where the agent needs to request additional captures from the toolbar, a `__xipeRefCommand` queue is introduced:

```
Agent writes: window.__xipeRefCommand = { action: "deep_capture", target: "comp-001" }
Toolbar polls: reads __xipeRefCommand, executes, clears, sets __xipeRefReady when done
```

This avoids replacing the existing polling architecture while enabling the new bi-directional needs.

## Scope Clarification

This idea is a **Change Request (CR) for FEATURE-030-B** (UIUX Reference Agent Skill & Toolbar). It covers:

- **In scope**: Toolbar UI redesign, offscreen canvas color picker with magnifier, role annotations, smart-snap component selector, agent analysis rubric, iterative validation loop, toast notifications, `__xipeRefCommand` channel.
- **Downstream skill availability**: `x-ipe-tool-brand-theme-creator` already exists. The mockup creation skill may need to be created or extended — this is **out of scope** for this CR but must be identified during requirement gathering.
- **Backward compatibility**: The current toolbar data format (`colors[]`, `elements[]`) is replaced by the new schema. No migration needed since references are session-based and not persisted between toolbar injections.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Hamburger menu shows exactly 2 options: "Catch Design Theme" and "Copy Design as Mockup"
- [ ] Current standalone color picker and element highlighter are removed
- [ ] Color picker uses offscreen canvas with circular magnifier (120px, 10x zoom, crosshair)
- [ ] Color picker works on images, video, canvas, CSS gradients, and text
- [ ] Colors can be annotated with roles (primary, secondary, accent, or custom text)
- [ ] "Create Theme" triggers brand-theme-creator skill and produces design-system.md
- [ ] Component selector smart-snaps to semantic containers with drag-handle resize
- [ ] Fallback to nearest sizeable `div` when no semantic container found
- [ ] Initial capture is lightweight (dimensions + screenshot + minimal CSS)
- [ ] Agent analysis rubric evaluates 5 dimensions (layout, typography, color, spacing, effects)
- [ ] Agent requests deeper capture when confidence is low
- [ ] Metadata is persisted via MCP before mockup generation
- [ ] Mockup generation validates against original screenshot (max 3 auto-iterations)
- [ ] Toast notifications show progress for all async operations
- [ ] Both modes share one panel, one data session
- [ ] `__xipeRefCommand` channel enables agent-to-toolbar communication

## Constraints & Considerations

- **CORS limitation**: Offscreen canvas cannot sample pixels from cross-origin images/iframes. Fallback: report limitation via toast ("Some cross-origin content may not be color-sampled").
- **Performance**: Rendering viewport to offscreen canvas for magnifier must use `requestAnimationFrame` throttling. Consider caching the canvas snapshot and only re-rendering on scroll/resize.
- **Toolbar injection**: Self-contained IIFE with all CSS scoped (prefixed selectors or shadow DOM) to avoid host page conflicts.
- **CSP restrictions**: Some pages block inline scripts or canvas operations. Toolbar should gracefully degrade with a toast notification.
- **Iteration limit**: Mockup validation loop capped at 3 auto-iterations. Human approval required beyond 3 to prevent infinite loops.
- **Screenshot comparison method**: TBD during technical design. Options: pixel-diff, SSIM, perceptual hash. Threshold targeting ~90% match.

## Brainstorming Notes

Key decisions made during brainstorming:

1. **Toolbar replacement**: The current standalone color picker and element highlighter are fully replaced. The hamburger menu with 2 modes is the only interface.
2. **Offscreen canvas for color picking**: Chosen over EyeDropper API (limited browser support, no custom magnifier) and existing canvas sampling (more universal via viewport-to-canvas rendering).
3. **Smart-snap for component selection**: Clicking snaps to nearest semantic HTML container, with drag handles for fine-tuning. Falls back to nearest sizeable `div` if no semantic element found within 5 levels.
4. **Lightweight-first capture strategy**: Initial capture is minimal. Agent decides if deeper DOM extraction is needed via a 5-dimension rubric — not the user.
5. **Iterative validation**: Agent generates mockup → screenshots → compares to original. Below threshold triggers re-analysis. Max 3 auto-iterations before human intervention.
6. **Minimal color role presets**: Only primary, secondary, accent + custom textbox.
7. **Bi-directional communication**: `__xipeRefCommand` queue for agent → toolbar requests during analysis, complementing the existing `__xipeRefReady` toolbar → agent signal.
8. **Metadata persistence before generation**: All captured data saved via MCP before mockup generation for resumability.

## References & Common Principles

### Applied Principles

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Step-by-step wizard hides complexity until each step is needed, avoiding cognitive overload.
- **Smart Defaults with Override**: Smart-snap selects the best container automatically but allows manual adjustment via drag handles.
- **Fail-Safe Iteration**: The 3-iteration cap prevents runaway loops while the human-approval escape hatch ensures quality.
- **Lightweight-First Data Collection**: Capture minimal data initially, deepen only when needed — reduces payload and speeds up the common case.
- **Persistence Before Processing**: Save all metadata before generation begins, ensuring resumability on failure.

### Design System Capture Best Practices

- **Token-based theming**: Colors map to semantic roles (primary, secondary, accent) rather than raw hex values, enabling theme portability.
- **Visual regression testing**: Comparing generated mockups to original screenshots via pixel-diff/SSIM is the industry standard for validating UI fidelity.
- **Component isolation**: Capturing components by semantic container (not arbitrary rectangles) produces more meaningful, reusable mockup units.
